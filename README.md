## Network Attached Storage System
Network attached storage system is a web based app connected to a local computer network, to provide data access to a group of clients. This system can provide file base data storage services to other devices on the network. Instead of using physical hard drives, we intend to use docker containers acting as FTP servers for storage. We also plan to implement an API service for the userâ€™s convenience to create their own clients.
